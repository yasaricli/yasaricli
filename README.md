### Hi there - Selam genÃ§ler ðŸ‘‹

For about `16 years` I have been involved in coding, **development**. During these `16 years` I have worked both as a `frontend and backend` developer. Thru the years I have been worked on many projects involving a variety of coding languages.

For the last `9 years` I have shifted most of my attention to **javascript**, especially **Meteor Framework**. This allowed me to progress fairly quickly in my aptitude with **javascript**. Generally I am more interested structure development.

Most of my time is spend working on **Open Source** projects.


Also I like to and do support **Open Source** projects and currently.

I am working as a *frontend developer* at [Tatilsepeti](https://github.com/tsepeti).

**I want to make things that make a difference.**
